- Kafka uses sharding/ partitions
- partitions are not topics - the same topic multiple partitions
- multiple topics cannot have the same partition
- partitions are copied and distributed to prevent dataloss when a broker goes down
- everything is isolated 
- every entry has an expiration date (example: notifications deleted after a year)
 
- which broker -> which topic -> which partition in the topic


Queue vs. pub-sub

- Queues are published once, consumed once, and then deleted. Singular section (aka Topic) in kafka model. 
- Pub-sub :: the whole kafka model

- cashiers, banks, toll collections
- Use cases:
	* a job is executed only once -- gvsu jobs for weekly and daily
- in visual example: format to 2180p to make it faster have mulitple machines run it faster -----> REASON IN NEXT POINT
- each topic is it's own queue:: WHY??
	* multiple partitions queued to be consumed by the consumer group 
	* can split partitions with machines - see visual example on slides [input in notes]
*** RULE: You need to have each partition consumed by a consumer --> one to one or many to one
